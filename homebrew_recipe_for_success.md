# Homebrew Recipe for Success
### Can we predict the end abv alcohol level of a beer from the ingredients used?

## Why would we want to do this?
Recent changes to UK alcohol taxation have resulted in a higher tax payment for a higher alcohol percentage (Abv) beverage. By discovering the correlation between ingredients and the final Abv, breweries can optimize recipes and brewing techniques for their products to reach a desired abv and meet set criteria for a desired taxation bracket.

## Methodology
Create a regression model to determine how quantities of ingredients, specifically sugar influence the final ABV alcohol percentage.
