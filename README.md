# About Me
I'm a data transator - a People Data Analyst who turns business needs into data-driven solutions; the middle-man between your questions and the raw data which may hold the truth!
With years of experience in People Anlytics and leading an HR Analytics team, I've built a solid reputation for delivering results. I blend traditional methods with data science to find the best answers using the most appropriate techniques and technologies. My background in training and eLearning helps me present insights in a clear and engaging way.
